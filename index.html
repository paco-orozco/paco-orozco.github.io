                <h1> I like to Make things </h1>
                <p> I have made images my entire life. When I was younger I thought that my profession was going to be as a penciller for comic books or as an illustrator for childrens bookâ€™s. I have always been attracted to visual images and more importantly I understand the power of images in culture and consumption. My love for the materials of pen and ink and other types of mediums has changed for the languages of the web. I now use HTML and CSS to communicate my ideas. I love the power of the internet and web applications. It is in this medium that I am allowed the opportunity to reach such a broad audience, something that is very difficult and limiting in the medium of paper. </p>

                  <li><em>HTML5</em></li>
                  <li><em>CSS</em></li>

                <p>This project resulted from my desire to merge technology with some form of
                design. I used d3.js to build a typography collage from Instagram comments. The app is completely built on the client side and is a single page app. Just navigate to the desired image and watch as the comments are made into a visually pleasing result.Technologies used: Instagram API, Ruby on Rails, d3.js, jQuery, tuktuk.css, and AJAX.

                <p> This was my first experience working in a group and it resulted in an amazing app. The app not only has accident data from Bay citizen data, but it is able to crowd source accident or hazard information. This is an amazing tool that reports on the quality of bicycle routes and allows the user to be a part of the experience.Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, AJAX, Google Maps API, and Facebook/Twitter for authentication.</p>

                <p> The second version of my initial Rnnr app, which gives weather conditions for runners. This is a Rails app and is a great foundation for future add-ons in potential version upgrades. I implemented the geo location API, which is native to HTML5, to automatically recognize the location data. I used jQuery AJAX to make another API request, which is all done on the client-side, to Weather Underground for the necessary data. I replaced the CSS framework Foundation with my own boiler-plate, with the purpose of having more control and singularity, all while maintaining the responsive elements of the app.</p>
